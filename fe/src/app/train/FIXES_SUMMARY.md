# Training Flow Fixes - Complete Summary

This document summarizes all fixes applied to the training flow to resolve issues with the Continue button and Fine-Tune dialog.

## Overview

Two major bugs were identified and fixed:

1. **Continue Button Not Working** - Clicking "Continue" on a training session didn't display results
2. **Fine-Tune Dialog Training Failed** - Submitting training from the fine-tune dialog returned "Field required: file" error

## Fix #1: Continue Button - Persist and Load Training Results

### Problem
When clicking "Continue" on a training session that already had results, users were taken to step 4 (Results), but no training results were displayed. The `trainingResult` state was `null` because it was only populated after completing a new training session.

### Solution
Implemented URL-based state management to persist and retrieve training entry IDs.

### Changes Made

#### 1. URL Parameter Management (`useTrainParams.ts`)
```typescript
export function useTrainParams() {
  return useQueryStates(
    {
      session: parseAsString.withDefault(""),
      step: parseAsInteger.withDefault(1),
      entryId: parseAsString.withDefault(""),  // ← Added
    },
    {
      history: "push",
      shallow: true,
    }
  );
}
```

#### 2. Load Training Entry on Navigation (`page.tsx`)
- Added `useEffect` that watches for `entryId` changes in URL params
- Fetches training entries when `entryId` is present
- Loads the specific entry and populates `trainingResult` and `modelName` states
- Sets `usingExistingCSV` flag based on session CSV status

#### 3. Continue Flow (`handleStartTraining`)
- When continuing with existing CSV, fetches latest training entry
- Sets URL params with `session`, `step: 4`, and `entryId`
- Results are automatically loaded by the `useEffect`

#### 4. Persist Entry ID After Training (`handleTrain`)
- Extracts `entryId` from API response after successful training
- Updates URL params to include the new entry ID
- Enables direct linking and page refresh persistence

### URL Structure
```
/train?session={sessionId}&step=4&entryId={entryId}
```

### Benefits
✅ Continue button works correctly and displays results
✅ Training results persist across page refreshes
✅ Direct linking to specific training results via URL
✅ Proper state management with URL as source of truth

## Fix #2: Fine-Tune Dialog - Support CSV URL Training

### Problem
When fine-tuning (clicking "Fine Tune" and submitting the dialog), training failed with:
```
422 Unprocessable Entity
Field required: file
```

The Python API expected a `file` field, but when fine-tuning, no new CSV was uploaded since the data was already in S3.

### Root Causes
1. Frontend had no file when fine-tuning (`file = undefined`)
2. Next.js API was forwarding a `null` file field to Python
3. Python API required the `file` field: `file: UploadFile = File(...)`
4. Missing validation for existing CSV URL availability

### Solution
Modified the entire stack to support both file upload AND CSV URL download.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Python API - Accept File OR CSV URL (`api/train_pipeline.py`)

**Updated endpoint signature:**
```python
async def train_with_cv(
    file: UploadFile = File(None),        # Made optional
    csv_url: str = Form(None),            # Added new parameter
    model_name: str = Form("xgboost"),
    # ... other params
):
```

**Added dual-mode data loading:**
```python
# Read and clean data
if file is not None:
    print(f"[TRAIN_CV] Using uploaded file: {file.filename}")
    content = await file.read()
    raw_df = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(content), comment="#")
elif csv_url is not None:
    print(f"[TRAIN_CV] Downloading CSV from URL: {csv_url}")
    import requests
    response = requests.get(csv_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print(f"[TRAIN_CV] CSV downloaded successfully, size: {len(response.content)} bytes")
    raw_df = pd.read_csv(io.BytesIO(response.content), comment="#")
else:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400, detail="Either file or csv_url must be provided"
    )
```

#### 2. Next.js API - Smart FormData Forwarding (`save-result/route.ts`)

**Fixed FormData forwarding logic:**
```typescript
// Create form data for Python API
const pythonFormData = new FormData();

// Copy all fields EXCEPT 'file' from the original formData
for (const [key, value] of formData.entries()) {
    if (key !== 'file') {
        pythonFormData.append(key, value);
    }
}

// Add file or csv_url depending on what's available
if (csvFile) {
    console.log("Appending file to Python API FormData");
    pythonFormData.append("file", csvFile);
} else if (csvUrl) {
    console.log("No file provided, appending csv_url:", csvUrl);
    pythonFormData.append("csv_url", csvUrl);
} else {
    console.error("ERROR: No file and no csv_url available!");
    return NextResponse.json(
        { success: false, error: "No CSV file or URL available for training" },
        { status: 400 }
    );
}
```

**Key insight:** Exclude the `file` field completely when not present (prevents sending null values that trigger validation errors).

#### 3. Frontend - Validation and State Management (`page.tsx`)

**Added validation in `handleTrain`:**
```typescript
// Check if we have a file or are using existing CSV
if (!file && !usingExistingCSV) {
    setTrainingError("No CSV file provided. Please upload a file or use an existing session with data.");
    return;
}
```

**Added session verification in `handleFineTuneSubmit`:**
```typescript
// Ensure we're flagged as using existing CSV for fine-tuning
if (!file && selectedSessionId) {
    console.log("Fine-tuning without new file, verifying session has CSV");
    const sessionResult = await getTrainingSession(selectedSessionId);
    if (sessionResult.success && sessionResult.session?.csvUrl) {
        console.log("Session has CSV URL, setting usingExistingCSV to true");
        setUsingExistingCSV(true);
    } else {
        console.error("Session doesn't have CSV URL!");
        setTrainingError("Session doesn't have a CSV file. Please upload a new file.");
        return;
    }
}
```

### Data Flow

#### New Training (First Time)
```
User uploads CSV → Frontend sends file → Next.js saves to S3 →
Next.js forwards file to Python → Python reads uploaded file →
Training completes
```

#### Fine-Tune (Using Existing CSV)
```
User clicks Fine Tune → No file uploaded → Frontend verifies CSV URL exists →
Frontend sends FormData without file → Next.js appends csv_url →
Python downloads from S3 URL → Training completes
```

### Benefits
✅ Fine-tune works without re-uploading CSV
✅ Leverages existing S3 public URLs
✅ Clear separation: file upload vs. CSV URL
✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
✅ Proper validation at each layer
✅ No breaking changes to existing flows

## Architecture Improvements

### Before
- Training results only in memory (lost on refresh)
- No way to link to specific results
- Fine-tune required re-uploading CSV
- Poor error handling for missing data

### After
- URL-based state management (persistent)
- Direct linking to training results
- Fine-tune reuses existing CSV from S3
- Comprehensive validation and logging
- Better user experience

## Key Takeaways

1. **URL as Source of Truth**: Using URL parameters for critical state (session, step, entryId) enables persistence and sharing

2. **Backend Flexibility**: Supporting both file upload and URL download makes the API more versatile

3. **FormData Handling**: Be careful when forwarding FormData - null/undefined fields can cause validation errors

4. **Public S3 URLs**: Leveraging public storage URLs eliminates need to re-upload data

5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Adding logs at each layer makes debugging multi-tier issues much easier
